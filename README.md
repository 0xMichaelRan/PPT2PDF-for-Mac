# iTrackpadSwitcher

iTrackpadSwitcher is an AppleScript application used to switch your keyboard setting between __Natural scroll__ and __Traditional Scroll__.

## Motivation

I love the Naturla Scroll of Mac OS Lion+ since its introduction in 2011. But I always feel it's a pain while using a mouse.

Now with this application, you wouldn't worry no more. Simply run this app whenever you connect/disconnect your mouse, and your scroll setting shall automatically be changed. Give it a try, you'll love it!

## How to setup

1. Open up the script with AppleScript Editor.

2. Click on "Run" and give it a try.

3. Click on "File" - "export" and select type "application". Close AppleScript Editor.

4. After you have the app, locate it in the Finder.

5. (This step is optional but import. You don't want an ugly-looking default Mac OS icon, right?) Simply right click, select "Show Package Content", and replace the file "iTrackpadSwitcher.app/Contents/Resources/applet.icns" with the icon from this repo.

6. At this point, open it and give a try again.

7. We're almost there. Open up your "Application" folder and drag the app into it. You have successfully installed iTrackpadSwitcher.

8. I use Mac OS 10.8 Moutain Lion, and I haven't tested on other versions of Max OS. If you find a bug, please let me know.

Enjoy!
